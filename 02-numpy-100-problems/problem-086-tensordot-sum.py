Consider a set of p matrices with shape (n,n) and a set of p vectors with shape (n,1). How to compute the sum of of the p matrix products at once? (result has shape (n,1))

import numpy as np

p, n = 10, 20
M = np.ones((p,n,n))
V = np.ones((p,n,1))
S = np.tensordot(M, V, axes=[[0, 2], [0, 1]])
print(S)

# It works, because:
# M is (p,n,n)
# V is (p,n,1)
# Thus, summing over the paired axes 0 and 0 (of M and V independently),
# and 2 and 1, to remain with a (n,1) vector.
