"""
Considering a four dimensions array, how to get sum over the last two axis at once?

import numpy as np

A = np.random.randint(0,10,(3,4,3,4))
# solution by passing a tuple of axes (introduced in numpy 1.7.0)
sum = A.sum(axis=(-2,-1))
print(sum)
# solution by flattening the last two dimensions into one
# (useful for functions that don't accept tuples for axis argument)
sum = A.reshape(A.shape[:-2] + (-1,)).sum(axis=-1)
print(sum)
